     The four types of path are:

     a) path-abempty:    absolute path
     b) path-absolute:   absolute path with non-empty initial segment
     c) path-rootless:   relative path
     d) path-noscheme:   relative path with no colon in first segment

     We have an additional boolean flag in this low-level conversion
     procedure which says that we're in the path-noscheme production.

     No nice way to vary the character set in a variadic procedure like this,
     so the URI and IRI-specific versions of these are preferable, or the
     above `vector->*-path' procedures.

     Procedure input is similar to the following Racket procedure:

     https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Manipulating_Paths.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._build-path%29%29

     However, the `base' initial argument, if it's a path, is merged using
     the above `merge-paths' procedure, so that it's similar to how relative
     references are resolved against a base.
